        <h3>Chiropractic Care</h3>
        <p>The doctors at Body in Balance are versed in providing manual and instrument assisted adjustments. These adjustments are a safe and effective treatment for people of all ages, from infants to elderly. Through chiropractic adjustments, our doctors are able to facilitate the correction of misalignments and postural imbalances that can accumulate in our bodies over time.

        <h3>Myofascial Release</h3>
        <p>Myofascial release is a great hands-on tool and partner to the chiropractic adjustment.  This natural approach provides lasting effects to the muscular system through sustained pressure. Through the muscle work, the doctor will be able to decrease pain and increase functionality. </p>
        <h3>Acupuncture</h3>
        <h3>Cup Therapy</h3>
        <h3>Compression Therapy</h3>
        <p>Compression boots or sleeves fit on the arm or leg like an outer layer of clothing, using compressed air to push metabolic waste such as lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, etc. out of the muscle tissue. Athletes have been using compression therapy for years to help recover from intense exercise, but this technology can be applied to the non-athlete as well. </p>
        <h3>Muscle Taping </h3>
        <p>The doctors at Body in Balance have been certified in the RockTape Functional Movement Kinesiology Taping course. This method is an evidence based approach to aid patients with any aches, pains, postural imbalances, scars, nerve entrapments, or reduction of edema.</p>
