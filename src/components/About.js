        <p>Dr. Lillian Sunderman was born and raised in a small town in Northwest Missouri. Before moving to the big city of Dallas and getting used to its fast paced scene, Lillian graduated from the University of Saint Mary with her Bachelor’s of Science and Master’s of Counseling Psychology.</p>

        <p>Lillian had always known that helping people was a part of “the plan,” so once she had been introduced to the power of chiropractic she had found her passion. Lillian graduated from Parker University and immediately emersed herself in chiropractic work. </p>

        <p>Lillian’s youth is matched with an excitement to provide patients with the best concierge chiropractic service.  Completing numerous seminars outside of Parker’s curriculum has earned her a certification in acupuncture, functional movement, soft tissue and more.</p>
